Some background about me:

Some time ago, I used to do WordPress development. This was the time that WordPress have just started having Custom Post Types and started to move from a Blog platform towards a full-blown CMS. 

For some years I did only WordPress development but at a point (5 years ago) I've moved to the pure JavaScript part to construct headless applications. During this time I have been writing a lot of JavaScript. Eventually 2 years ago we've decided to use ReactJS as a main UI tool in our team.
